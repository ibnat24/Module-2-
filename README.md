## 📊 Data Generation

The system uses actual gameplay data as the baseline and generates additional mock sessions for robust predictive modeling.

### Actual Gameplay Data (Session 0)
Based on your 23-round gameplay with realistic patient arrival patterns:
- **Emergency Walk-in**: 2-8 patients/round (avg: 4.3)
- **Emergency Ambulance**: 0-3 patients/round (avg: 1.3)
- **Surgery**: Front-loaded, 0-3 patients in early rounds
- **Critical Care**: Sparse, 0-1 patients in early rounds
- **Step Down**: Front-loaded with occasional late arrivals

### Mock Data Generation
The `data_generator.py` module creates 4 additional sessions with:
- Statistical properties matching actual gameplay
- Realistic variation (±20-30%)
- Time-based patterns (early/mid/late game dynamics)
- Department-specific constraints

---

## 🔮 Predictive Analytics Methods

### Ensemble Forecasting
Combines three methods with weighted averaging:

1. **Moving Average (30% weight)**
   - Uses last 3 rounds across all sessions
   - Good for short-term stability

2. **Time-Based Forecast (40% weight)** ⭐ Primary
   - Historical average for specific round number
   - Accounts for round-specific patterns
   - Includes confidence intervals

3. **Trend Analysis (30% weight)**
   - Linear regression on recent 5 rounds
   - Captures increasing/decreasing patterns

### Surge Detection
- Compares forecast to 75th percentile threshold
- HIGH alert: >90th percentile
- MODERATE alert: >75th percentile

## 🎮 How to Use the Dashboard

### Control Panel
- **Current Round Input**: Manually set the current round (1-23)
- **Update Round Button**: Refresh dashboard with selected round
- **Simulate Next Round Button**: Auto-advance and generate new patient arrivals

### Dashboard Sections

#### Left Column
1. **Department Status Heat Map**
   - Visual capacity utilization
   - Color-coded: Green (good) → Yellow (moderate) → Red (critical)

2. **Current Resource Allocation**
   - Staff distribution by department
   - Current patient counts

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Average wait time
   - Total patients in system
   - Patients treated
   - Progress tracker

#### Right Column
1. **Predictive Forecast**
   - Next 4 rounds expected arrivals
   - Department-specific trends
   - Interactive line chart

2. **Staffing Recommendations**
   - Suggested nurse/doctor allocation
   - Based on forecasted demand
   - Color-coded changes (green=stable, red=increase needed)

3. **Historical Arrival Patterns**
   - Average arrivals per round across all sessions
   - Current round marker
   - Helps identify typical patterns

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adjust Capacity Settings
Edit `CAPACITY_CONFIG` in `dashboard.py`:
```python
CAPACITY_CONFIG = {
    'emergency_walkin': {
        'patients_per_nurse': 4,    # Ratio
        'patients_per_doctor': 8,   # Ratio
        'beds': 15                  # Total beds
    },
    # ... other departments
}
```

### Modify Forecast Horizon
Change the number of rounds to forecast in `dashboard.py`:
```python
future_forecasts = analytics.forecast_next_n_rounds(current_round, n=4)  # Change n
```

### Adjust Alert Sensitivity
Modify threshold percentile in `predictive_analytics.py`:
```python
alerts = analytics.detect_surge(forecasts, threshold_percentile=75)  # Lower = more alerts
```

---

## 📈 Validation for Gameplay 2

### Recommended Testing Protocol

1. **Baseline Run** (No Dashboard)
   - Play one round normally
   - Record metrics: wait times, bottlenecks, patient outcomes

2. **Dashboard-Assisted Run**
   - Use dashboard predictions to pre-allocate resources
   - Follow staffing recommendations
   - React to surge alerts
   - Record same metrics

3. **Comparison Analysis**
   - Wait time reduction
   - Improved resource utilization
   - Fewer bottlenecks
   - Better patient throughput

### Metrics to Track
- Average wait time per department
- Number of patients successfully treated
- Resource utilization rates
- Response time to surges
- Staff satisfaction (subjective)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard won't start
```bash
# Check if port 8050 is already in use
lsof -i :8050  # On Mac/Linux
netstat -ano | findstr :8050  # On Windows

# Use different port
# Edit dashboard.py: app.run_server(port=8051)
```

### Import errors
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### No data showing
- Ensure `data_generator.py` ran successfully
- Check console for error messages
- Verify historical_data is being generated
